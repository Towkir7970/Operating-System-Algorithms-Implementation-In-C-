# Operating-System-Algorithms-Implementation-In-C-
In This repository, there will be implementations of some algorithms used very often in operating systems including file management, memory management, disk arm scheduling etc. All the implementations here is on C++ except Producer Consumer problem.
Topics:
  i) Deadlock: 1) Deadlock Detection 2) Bankers Algorithm
  ii) Disk Arm Scheduling: 1) C-SCAN 2) Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) 
  iii) File Management: 1) Contiguous 2) Non-Contiguous
  iv) Memory Management: 1) Best Fit 2) First Fit 3) Worst Fit
  v) Process Scheduling: 1) Shortest Job First 2) Priority Scheduling with Arrival Time 3) Round Robin Algorithm with Arrival Time
  vi) Producer Consumer Problem
  vii) Page Replacement: 1) FIFO 2) LRU 3) Optimal
